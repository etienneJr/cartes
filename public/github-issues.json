une fiche produit que j'avais écrit à l'origine de ce projet. Ne pas oublier ces expressions de besoin, voir comment on y répond dans le temps. \r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n## Voyage éco - Application de voyage sans voiture individuelle\r\n\r\nT'arrives sur le site, tu as un seul champ de recherche (comme google.com, super sobre) qui te dit : \"où allez-vous ?\". \r\n\r\nTu rentres une adresse de destination, précise. Par exemple si tu vas à Groix, tu mets la localité, pas \"Groix\" ni \"Lorient\". Par exemple, si tu vas à dans la maison de famille en Bretagne, tu mets Kerlochouarn, pas \"Brest\" ni \"Ploumoguer\". Si tu vas au camping de la Brousse dans le Tarn, tu tapes directement son nom.\r\n\r\nEnsuite, une carte qui prend l'essentiel de l'écran apparait et zoom sur le lieu (comme Google maps à ce stade), puis t'indique instantanément les gares SNCF les plus proches.\r\n\r\nPour chacune, en survol, tu vois le nombre de train par jour et donc une classification visuelle qui va de \"inactive\" (presque cachée du coup) à \"gare majeure\" en passant par \"gare départementale\". \r\n\r\nLes destinations principales de la gare sont indiquées, par exemple pour Landivisiau tu vois \"Brest\" à gauche et \"Morlaix, Saint-Brieuc, Rennes\" à droite. Pour Rennes tu vois \"Toutes directions\", donc un peu comme les fameux panneaux de voiture.\r\n\r\nTu cliques sur une gare, l'app t'indique comment faire le chemin Gare -> ta destination *en partant du principe que tu n'as pas de voiture individuelle* : transports en commun, vélo, ou voiture de location s'il y en a dans la gare. \r\n\r\nL'interface se concentre sur l'essentiel : te donner le temps de trajet, la fréquence horaire, le dénivelé pour le vélo, le côté sécurisé et agréable du chemin pour le vélo, ou pas. \r\n\r\nÀ ce stade, dans de nombreuses situations, tu as déjà compris que tu seras à poil en termes de transports en commun. C'est un objectif clef de l'appli : te permettre de savoir en 2 minutes si ça va le faire ou pas sans voiture ou sans vélo. \r\n\r\nEnsuite depuis la gare, les trains pour remonter à ton lieu de départ, comme un panneau d'affichage bleu SNCF en gare mais filtré vers ta destination.

It's a rare thing. The people around me are 99% French-speaking, and they motivate me. In France, apart from well funded projects, translations in French are often bad. Look at this platform where we're developing : the github team is for political reasons not introducing translation, despite their wealth. This needs to be counterbalanced. \r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that It's possible that in 6 months' time, the use of Cartes won't be wide, that the assumptions about the ingredients for success weren't the right ones. I prefer to test a roll-out in France and expand only if there is initial success. As I write these lines, 8 months after the start, we have no more than 20 000 users per month. It's not enough to think international :rocket:.  \r\n\r\nOf course, **if someone is willing to devote 3 months at 2 days a week, plus a maintenance effort over time of multiple days per month** (a rough estimate), **we'll be happy to discuss translation**. \r\n\r\nOf course, something that doesn't work in France, for various reasons, could work abroad if e.g. **backed by an organisation that has the will, the money and / or the firepower to promote a translated version of Cartes**.\r\n\r\nWe'll then have to discuss with limited time about the state of the art frameworks for translation, that should not dramatically impair dev time. We don't want yet to slow down. \r\n\r\nLast but not least, on top of t9n, i18n is hard. In France, we haven't yet been able to correctly display the local language translation of places, only the breton language is. We haven't yet been able to integrate the transit data of all of the french hexagone. Etc. \r\n\r\nFor example, the [transitous](https://transitous.org) project, quite similar to laem/gtfs+laem/motis, went all-in on international coverage, instead of starting small and being sure that transit works in all of e.g. France before trying germany. They've got world coverage, but last time I tried my regional capital city of Rennes didn't work. Well maybe they just undesrestimated France's digial illiteracy ^^ : lots of GTFS data in France have to be retreated to work. Could be way simpler in Switzerland or Germany (and probably way more complex in other countries).

This needs to be counterbalanced.</p>\r\n<p>Also keep in mind that It's possible that in 6 months' time, the use of Cartes won't be wide, that the assumptions about the ingredients for success weren't the right ones. I prefer to test a roll-out in France and expand only if there is initial success. As I write these lines, 8 months after the start, we have no more than 20 000 users per month. It's not enough to think international :rocket:.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, <strong>if someone is willing to devote 3 months at 2 days a week, plus a maintenance effort over time of multiple days per month</strong> (a rough estimate), <strong>we'll be happy to discuss translation</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, something that doesn't work in France, for various reasons, could work abroad if e.g. <strong>backed by an organisation that has the will, the money and / or the firepower to promote a translated version of Cartes</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>We'll then have to discuss with limited time about the state of the art frameworks for translation, that should not dramatically impair dev time. We don't want yet to slow down.</p>\r\n<p>Last but not least, on top of t9n, i18n is hard. In France, we haven't yet been able to correctly display the local language translation of places, only the breton language is. We haven't yet been able to integrate the transit data of all of the french hexagone. Etc.</p>\r\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://transitous.org\">transitous</a> project, quite similar to laem/gtfs+laem/motis, went all-in on international coverage, instead of starting small and being sure that transit works in all of e.g. France before trying germany. They've got world coverage, but last time I tried my regional capital city of Rennes didn't work. Well maybe they just undesrestimated France's digial illiteracy ^^ : lots of GTFS data in France have to be retreated to work. Could be way simpler in Switzerland or Germany (and probably way more complex in other countries).</p>"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/573","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/573/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/573/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/573/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cartesapp/cartes/issues/573","id":2499664301,"node_id":"I_kwDOCiUfpc6U_dmt","number":573,"title":"Erreurs diverses dans les tuiles \"france\"","user":{"login":"laem","id":1177762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzc3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1177762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem","html_url":"https://github.com/laem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-09-01T20:17:20Z","updated_at":"2024-09-01T20:17:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"- une rivière en boucle devient un réservoir par erreur https://forum.openstreetmap.fr/t/presentation-de-cartes-app/20566/399?u=maelito2000\r\n- un rendu psychédélique parfois https://forum.openstreetmap.fr/t/presentation-de-cartes-app/20566/397?u=maelito2000","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"markdownBody":"<ul>\r\n<li>une rivière en boucle devient un réservoir par erreur <a href=\"https://forum.openstreetmap.fr/t/presentation-de-cartes-app/20566/399?u=maelito2000\">https://forum.openstreetmap.fr/t/presentation-de-cartes-app/20566/399?u=maelito2000</a></li>\r\n<li>un rendu psychédélique parfois <a href=\"https://forum.openstreetmap.fr/t/presentation-de-cartes-app/20566/397?u=maelito2000\">https://forum.openstreetmap.fr/t/presentation-de-cartes-app/20566/397?u=maelito2000</a></li>\r\n</ul>"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/571","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/571/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/571/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/571/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cartesapp/cartes/issues/571","id":2499413646,"node_id":"I_kwDOCiUfpc6U-gaO","number":571,"title":"Panoramax 3","user":{"login":"laem","id":1177762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzc3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1177762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem","html_url":"https://github.com/laem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2024-09-01T11:34:09Z","updated_at":"2024-12-24T15:57:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Après le 1, qui intégrait juste une miniature et un lien vers panoramax.xyz, le 2 qui fait une intégration à la streetview, on peut lister ici les améliorations pour la v3. \r\n\r\n- [ ] parfaire la vue mobile.

Or, on dispose de tout ça grâce aux données GTFS de la SNCF. \r\n\r\nIl serait donc possible de faire un système qui remplace A ou B par la grande gare de la ville. Le mieux me semble être d'afficher les gares SNCF sur la carte quand on rentre en mode itinéraire, de façon très imposante quand le zoom est haut, ce qui permet à l'utilisateur de  les choisir. \r\n\r\nIl faudrait aussi, quand il n'y a pas de transports en commun dans la zone, lui conseiller de partir de la gare. C'est dommage que Motis ne le fasse pas automatiquement, en mode \"si tu arrives à rejoindre cette gare à 20 km, y a un trajet\" mais je ne crois pas qu'il soit cablé pour ça. Potentiellement, pour traverser la France en TGV, même un trajet d'1h en voiture pour rejoindre la gare est justifiable.

Mais plus de couverture des types, notamment au fur et à mesure de la convergence des fonctionnalités (par exemple, la gestion des images Wikimedia, Wikipedia, Wikidata, Panoramax dont certains bouts de codes sont actuellement séparés, bazar vs cathédrale), ça oui !</p>\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/334","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/334/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/334/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/334/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cartesapp/cartes/issues/334","id":2349295077,"node_id":"I_kwDOCiUfpc6MB2Xl","number":334,"title":"LISEZ-MOI / Guide de contribution à Cartes","user":{"login":"laem","id":1177762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzc3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1177762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem","html_url":"https://github.com/laem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6966685971,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCiUfpc8AAAABnz8xEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/labels/%F0%9F%93%96%20Wiki","name":"📖 Wiki","color":"E7B824","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-06-12T17:12:31Z","updated_at":"2024-12-02T19:21:53Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":" [cartes.app est le gros chantier de 2024](https://github.com/laem/futureco/issues/161) développé sur ce dépôt.\r\n \r\n Je vais lister ici quelques éléments importants à savoir. \r\n\r\n> Pour discuter de ces points, merci de créer une issue qui référence celle-ci. \r\n \r\n ## Puis-je créer des issues (bugs, idées, etc) ? \r\n \r\n Bien sûr, l'application a plein de problèmes qu'il faut lister.

De même, l'idéologie dominante qui présente le succès de l'action écologique comme dépendant d'un escalier de l'engagement qui commencerait par une 1ère étape de \"nudge\" douce, notamment portée par l'ADEME et le gouvernement, est rejetée dans les motivations mêmes de ce projet. Depuis qu'elle est appliquée, il y a au moins 20 ans, on constate son échec cuisant.

Ne faites pas attention au ton qui pourrait paraitre dédaigneux, j'ai beaucoup de respect pour chacun de ces projets. Ils correspondent à des usages réels existants, et ils ont chacun pour l'instant 1000 x plus d'utilisateurs que cartes.app :)\r\n\r\nConcernant openstreetmap.org, ce site a tellement de défaut que c'est vite plié. Cartes pas vectorielles, mainteneurs qui luttent contre les nouveautés (d'où les cartes pas vectorielles depuis 5 ans), etc. On peut noter aussi que c'est un site technique dès son nom : les gens recherchent bien plus que des \"cartes de rues\", littéralement \"streetmap\". Un détail qui fait déjà une grosse différence pour le grand public. OSM est le nom historique d'une base de donnée qui s'est étendue à des milliers d'autres choses que des rues...\r\n\r\nConcernant OSMand, c'est simple : c'est une appli (pas Web) destinée aux geeks. Je l'adore, pour mes sorties vélo, mais avec ses choix d'interface, elle ne sera jamais grand public. \r\n\r\nOrganic Maps : super appli grand public, ma recommandation pour les téléphones. Pas de version Web. Pas de transports en commun. Plans pour ces deux choses qui sont loins d'etre convaincants. Pas de photos. Peu de fonds de carte. Pas de cartes en ligne, il faut d'abord télécharger -> pas grand public. \r\n\r\nCartes IGN : une surprise pour moi de la voir sortir la semaine dernière ! Super initiative.

à #169 \r\n\r\nEn bref, par priorité : \r\n- toujours sur la Bretagne\r\n- améliorer la vue calcul d'itinéraire\r\n- proposer une vue \"les départs près de chez moi\" avec un mode géolocalisé par défaut\r\n- proposer un bouton \"y aller\" sur les POI\r\n- tracer les résultats sur la carte \r\n\r\n## Calcul d'itinéraire\r\n\r\n- proposer deux vues : l'une simplifiée (voir apple /google maps) et l'une calendrier, celle développée actuellement\r\n  - dans la vue simplifiée, aller à l'essentiel : Ligne 3 toutes les 30 minutes dans 4 min, 6 minutes de marche\r\n  - mettre en doré / marquer d'une étoile la meilleure recommandation quand y a pas photo\r\n- pour les trajets longue distance plutôt qu'urbains, quand destination n'est pas à distance marchable de la gare, passer en mode vélo train.\r\n  - on reprend alors la fonctionnalité actuelle de la carte des gares avec au clic (vélo / TeC) + train depuis cette gare\r\n  - déclencher tout ça avec un bouton sur le POI, plutôt que sans prévenir ; télécharger les gares json à la demande\r\n  \r\n**Après réflexion**, je me demande s'il ne faut pas faire un mix de vue simplifiée et vue calendrier : on ne choisit qu'un trajet optimal (tant pis si dans de rares cas il y en a 2), et on l'affiche en haut du calendrier en résumé : \"le top c'est le C1, il passe toutes les 12 minutes en ce moment et vous y amène en 17 minutes.

Bien plus belle et mieux faite, mais elle me confirme l'intérêt d'en faire la vue principale. Ils proposent aussi l'option vélo vers arrêt de métro puis métro, c'est très très cool (et c'est la plus rapide dans mon cas... après le vélo tout court évidemment). \r\n\r\nLa priorité me semble donc d'améliorer cette vue et de les tracer sur la carte. \r\n\r\nJ'aimerais proposer aussi au clic la conversion de segments de bus en vélo, avec une petite animation sympa.

Dans une métropole comme Rennes, il y a tellement de lignes de bus, elles se chevauchent sur les grands axes, etc. Ni Google ni Apple ne les dessinent, ils ne font que le métro, et les bus au clic. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/laem/futureco/assets/1177762/71a553f7-27d2-4db7-a962-bf5564f766cc)\r\n![image](https://github.com/laem/futureco/assets/1177762/e411aa50-79e5-4228-9127-cceeeb879377)\r\n\r\nVoir [cet article de blog de Transit](https://blog.transitapp.com/transit-maps-apple-vs-google-vs-us-cb3d7cd2c362/) qui montre l'exemple.

Pour les cartes officielles, de grandes libertés sont en effet prises avec les tracés pour que ça soit lisible. Pourtant, l'avantage qu'on a par rapport aux cartes officielles, c'est le zoom. Il serait relativement facile de n'afficher les lignes qu'[en fonction de leur fréquence](https://github.com/laem/futureco/issues/210). Le métro se verrait donc au zoom max, puis les bus principaux, puis les bus de moindre importance, etc. Il faudrait faire une exception pour le train et les cars en intégrant le fait qu'ils proposent une faible fréquence mais une grande importance pour le voyage. \r\n\r\nAutre point important : pour les villes moins dotées (exemple : Chateaugiron), une carte des transports en commun est à la fois importante et beaucoup plus facile à réaliser. À Rennes, tout le monde sait qu'il y a des bus, il y a une app mal faite mais existante, etc. À Chateaugiron, il faut faire découvrir le réseau de TeC. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/laem/futureco/assets/1177762/e477a911-559e-4cfe-8e0d-138f25edbfab)\r\n\r\nRessources : \r\n- https://humantransit.org/category/maps\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTLCfl01zuE\r\n\r\n### Carte par ligne \r\n\r\nJ'ai déjà mis une première version des cartes par ligne. Quand je clique sur un arrêt, ça déclenche la vue par ligne, présentant la ligne et des cercles pour ses arrêts. \r\n\r\nJe l'ai codée uniquement pour Rennes, et au premier essai je vois que ça marche pour Lorient, ça fait plaisir.

me permets de séparer les retours ci-dessous des retours déjà effectués sur l'issue #123 car ils ne concernant pas le modèle de calcul mais seulement des retours UX pour rendre l'usage du simulateur plus efficace et agréable.\r\n\r\n**Retour n°1  - Le sélecteur de port ou ville est complexe à utiliser :** \r\n* On ne sait pas exactement ce qu'il faut saisir, ni en quelque langue. Ex : Je voulais simuler un trajet Toulon - Majorque (l'île espagnole). Je n'ai aucun problème pour saisir Toulon, mais pour Majorque (qui est le nom \"francais\" de l'ile), je ne trouve rien. Il faut finalement que je tape le nom \"officiel\" de l'ile : Mallorca. Mais ensuite quand je tape \"Mallorca\" le sélecteur me propose \"Palmas\". J'ai du aller faire une recherche Google pour réaliser que Palma est la ville principale de Majorque. Finalement cela fonctionne bien mais c'est peu clair et peut facilement amener l'utilisateur à se tromper. (ce qui m'était arrivé).\r\n* Un autre problème, est que si je tape \"Tou\", le sélecteur me propose \"Toulon\", je sélectionne, \"Toulon\" est bien prise en compte mais le sélecteur affiche toujours \"Tou\", ce qui n'est pas optimal et qui produit une accumulation d'affichage. Il faudrait remplacer automatiquement le sélecteur par la destination choisie par l'utilisateur. Si ce dernier souhaite refaire apparaître le sélecteur il lui suffit de cliquer sur le crayon pour éditer. Cela permettra d'alléger l'affichage et d'éviter d'avoir des sélecteurs à moitié rempli.\r\n\r\n**Retour n°2 - Le sélecteur d'horaire est complexe :** \r\n* Toujours pour mon voyage Toulon - Palma. La première fois en rentrant les horaires je n'ai pas fait attention, et par défaut \"le lendemain\" est pré-selectionné. Mon trajet étant de 06:30 à 20:00, je valide. Je me retrouve avec un faible impact CO2. Mais après vérification, j'ai compris que j'avais mis une arrivée le lendemain à 20h et non le jour-même si qui change tout sur l'impact CO2 et donc peut m'induire en erreur (40kg de CO2 au lieu de 150).\r\n* Il faudrait trouver un moyen de simplifier la sélection des options \"le jour-même, le lendemain, J+X\". Un truc tout simple serait de le mettre sur la même ligne que la selection de l'heure d'arrivée. Ainsi le remplissage de ce champ serait plus compréhensible pour l'utilisateur et plus cohérent dans le parcours. J'ai l'air d'insister sur un petit détail, mais je suis sûr que si on faisait des tests utilisateurs pleins de gens ne comprendraient pas bien cette option qui est peu expliquée et qui change énormément l'impact du voyage si elle est mal remplie\r\n\r\n**Retour n°3 - Fin de simulation **\r\n* Je pense que cela aurait énormément de valeur d'afficher un texte explicatif et récapitulatif sur l'écran de fin en plus de l'impact CO2. \r\n* En effet, prendre un ferry est un geste qui a un impact loin d'être négligeable (d'où ce calculateur) mais il est important que les gens ait une synthèse de pourquoi ça a un impact et de comment le réduire. Bien évidemment, si les gens creusent et sont attentifs en répondant aux questions, ils vont comprendre d'eux-même que pour réduire l'impact il faut prendre le moins de place et de services à bord tout en privilégiant un voyage lent. Mais pourquoi ne pas le résumer à nouveau sur l'écran de conclusion ? Ça ne coûte pas grand chose et cela augmente énormément la valeur informative de ce calculateur. \r\n* De plus, il pourrait être intéressant d'ajouter quelques ordres de grandeur (même si à nouveau, les gens peuvent bricoler le simulateur pour comprendre par eux-même) et d'expliquer : \"En privilégiant un ferry de nuit, on divise par X l'impact\", ou alors \"en ne consommant pas les services à bords on réduit en moyenne de Y\", ou encore, \"ne pas prendre sa voiture et voyager en vélo ou en louer une sur place permet de diviser par Z l'impact\". Ces petites phrases peuvent avoir un réel apport pédagoique et de sensibilisation. \r\n* On pourrait imaginer un écran à la manière de l'écran des actions sur NGC, avec une liste des améliorations pour améliorer son voyage : Si tu change telle réponse à telle question tu perds 25%, et si tu change ça tu réduits de 40%. \r\n\r\n**Retour n°4 - Comparaison **\r\n* Je sais que je force avec cette feature, mais pour moi la comparaison c'est LA feature manquante de futureco !\r\nIci, il pourrait être hyper pertinent d'afficher automatiquement l'équivalent du trajet en avion pour comparer (en prenant des hypothèse de classe eco et de trainées de condensation) pour afficher s'il est vraiment avantageux de prendre le ferry ou non ? Et si il y a une différence est-ce qu'elle est significative.\r\n* Ex : Pour Toulon - Mallorca en ferry sans voiture, sans cabine, etc j'ai 145kg AR mais en avion (depuis Marseille) j'ai 472kg AR. La différence est quand même significative. En revanche 150kg c'est l'ordre de grandeur d'un voyage de 1500 km en traversant la France en voiture diesel à 2 dans la voiture.\r\nDonc permettre la comparaison serait vraiment une manière de rendre le calculateur vraiment concret pour les utilisateurs qui souhaitent faire un choix et arbitrer entre des moyens de transports.\r\n\r\n**Retour n°5 - les suggestions de Trajet **\r\n* Quand on arrive sur la page du calculateur du ferry, on a ces 3 suggestions de voyage sur lesquelles on a envie de (on peut) cliquer. Malheureusement au lieu d'avoir le détail du trajet ou autre, on arrive soit sur le page du \"budget personnel\" soit sur la documentation publicode pour le ferry. Pour un utilisateur non-averti, cela peut-être frustrant car il ne comprend pas pourquoi il n'a juste pas le détail pour le voyage qu'il vient de sélectionner.\r\n* Si l'utilisateur clique sur une des propositions, il devrait simplement aller sur le page de fin de simulation avec les détails des calculs pour en savoir plus, sur les hypothèses (voiture, cabine, etc?) \r\n\r\n@laem ça fait pas mal de retours, mais au moins ils sont centralisés dans cette issue, et ça peut faire office de support de travail pour la suite.\r\nJe veux bien me pencher sur le retour n°3, je pense qu'il y a quelque chose de facile à faire à court terme pour immédiatement apporter de la valeur aux utilisateurs.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cartesapp/cartes/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"markdownBody":"<p>Je me permets de séparer les retours ci-dessous des retours déjà effectués sur l'issue #123 car ils ne concernant pas le modèle de calcul mais seulement des retours UX pour rendre l'usage du simulateur plus efficace et agréable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Retour n°1  - Le sélecteur de port ou ville est complexe à utiliser :</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On ne sait pas exactement ce qu'il faut saisir, ni en quelque langue.
